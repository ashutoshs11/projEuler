My solutions to Project Euler problems

##Reason
Comparing notes and promoting discussions. There is no intention to enable cheating of just copying scores to create a high score. The main motivation for this repo is to have a place where someone who is stuck may get some ideas about how to go ahead with one of the ways to solve a problem.

##Terms of Use
You are free to use the content of the repo as you wish except for submitting the answer to project euler without first exhausing all methods at your disposal.
